Case 633: 11/5/2014 dict=STC, L= [L=8952], hw=glAnatA, user=Odile Caujolle
old = the text under glAnatA is: [L=8952] [p= 239,1]  glānatā- glāni- f. fait de se faner, exténuation, langueur.

comment = Typo sûr  Hi Jim , i remind you that in all French words, û has been written ū. There is probably some reason, but as you can select the French words from the Sanskrit ones, it probably can be easely corrected. Regards, Odile Caujolle
