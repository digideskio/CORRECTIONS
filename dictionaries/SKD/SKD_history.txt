Sep 2013 - May 2014  Several errors corrected during the initial digitization
  processing.
  See manualByLine0.txt in the skdxml download
  1. There is a 3-column table beginning on page 2-930 and continuing through
   page 2-932.  This table is under headword nyAyaH.
   The original coding used an '<HI>' line prefix in several lines.
   Elsewhere in the dictionary, lines beginning with <HI> indicate the
   start of a new headword.  '<HI>' was changed to '<>' to avoid this headword 
   confusion.
  2. Under headword SikzA
   Changed to same form as in Ap90 (Oct 20, 2014)
   Z =  jihvamuliya, V = upadhmaniya
