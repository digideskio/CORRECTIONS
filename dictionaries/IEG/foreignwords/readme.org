  Find non-Sanskrit headwords in IEG, and print two displays

python foreignwords.py ../../../orig/ieg.txt ../../ieghw2.txt foreignwords.txt foreignwords.org

The program searches for certain words ('Tamil', 'Telugu', etc.) in the
text for a headword. If one of these words is found, it writes 
the word to foreignwords.txt, and writes the text and links to 
foreignwords.org .

It is certain that there are a few false positives (i.e.,
headwords that really are Sanskrit words), maybe 100-200.  Some of these
are like aDikAra (where 'cf.' appears).
;  <P>{%Adhikāra,%} cf. Tamil {%Adigāram%} (EI 25); same as {%Adhikārin%}
;  <>(SII 1), explained as ‘a magistrate’.


It is almost certain that not all foreign words are identified.
  

As currently written, only the first line of the text for an entry is
searched.   This restriction is thought to limit the number of false
positives.  It is not known whether it misses some foreign words.

As of this note (Mar 2, 2016) 917 headwords (out of 7895 total headwords)
are identified as foreign.
